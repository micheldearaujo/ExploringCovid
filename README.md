In this project I will walk through a SQL data exploration, cleaning and visualization in Tableau.<br>
The dataset can be downloaded at [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths).<br>
For this project I will work mainly with PostgreSQL for data exploration and cleaning and Tableau for Dashboards making. I hope to exercise and improve my SQL skills. Feel welcome to give your feedback. Hope you enjoy!<br>
