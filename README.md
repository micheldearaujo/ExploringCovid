## Introduction
  <p>

The Covid-19 pandemic has changed our lives in a way we have not been prepared for. Thinking about this, I decided to practice my SQL muscles exploring some data about the Covid around the world using PostgreSQL and Tableau for visualization. In this project I will walk through a SQL data exploration, cleaning and visualization in Tableau. <br>
The dataset can be downloaded at [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths). <br>
I hope to exercise and improve my SQL skills. Feel free to give your feedback. This is a really basic project, so let's get into it, hope you enjoy!<br>
